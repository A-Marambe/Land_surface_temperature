# Land_surface_temperature google earth engine
This project for monitoring satellite image based landsurface temperature rapped around Google earthengine. There will be a seperate project in R for easy data trasfer for statistical analysis.

1. project has functionality to download Landsat 8 images based on a given location.

2. project has functionality to calculate Land_surface_temperature based on thermal bands and vegetation index calculated using optical bands.

# for R code
i. Frist time users-
   Install packages before run 
    1)ggplot2
    2)rgdal
    3)raster

ii. Open the code in R. Change the 
    working directory name and image names, and run. 
	
iii.Code is self explanetary with frequently added comments.

iv. Please use a GUI gis software to produce presentable
    maps after saving LST products. 
	
 v. For large data volumes, may use loops and meta data in table format
